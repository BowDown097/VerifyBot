# Epic Games Verification Guide
1. Go to https://legendary.gl/epiclogin and accept the authorization message if there is one. You should see a page (JSON file) that shows a ``redirectUrl``, ``authorizationCode``, and ``sid``.
2. Run the **/verifyepic** command in the #verify channel and paste in the ``authorizationCode`` from the above step. If you don't know what you're doing, see the below images.

## How can I trust this to not do anything spooky?
Well, thing is you really can't 100%, but I've done the most I can to make it as safe as possible. Here's the facts:
- No information is exposed to other users of the server.
- The bot is completely open source. You can check the code for anything spooky.
- Your authorization code and access token are invalidated right after the command is ran.
- The server's really big and I'd say I like it. I don't care about Epic Games stuff and it would be stupid to throw everything away for it.

If there's anything I can do to make it less spooky on the code side of things, then create an issue with some details, but I don't think more can be done.
